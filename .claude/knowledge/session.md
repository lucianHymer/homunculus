### [20:24] [architecture] Phase 2 Overcomplete Implementation
**Details**: Phase 2 implementation went beyond requirements and already includes complete routing logic for Phase 3-5. The processWebhook() function already handles all three command types ([review], [accept], PR review) and routes events properly. Only needs real gh CLI prompts replacing the echo test commands at lines 108, 113, and 118 in server.js.
**Files**: server.js

### [20:25] [implementation] Phase 3-5 Complete Implementation
**Details**: Phases 3-5 are now complete. Replaced test echo prompts with real Claude commands:
- [review]: Uses gh issue view to read, gh issue comment to post analysis
- [accept]: Uses gh issue view to read, implements solution, creates branch/PR with gh pr create
- PR review: Uses gh pr view to read feedback, gh pr checkout to get branch, then commits/pushes fixes
All three phases implemented in single edit to server.js lines 108-124.
**Files**: server.js, test-phase3.js
