# Phase 2 Claude Integration Workflow

## Implementation Complete
Successfully implemented Phase 2 with Claude CLI integration.

## Key Features Implemented
- **Process Spawning**: Uses Node.js spawn() with detached processes
- **Workspace Management**: WORKSPACE_DIR environment variable (defaults to /workspace)
- **Repository Handling**: Clones repos with gh CLI, graceful fallback to mkdir
- **Task Isolation**: Unique work directories using {repo-name}-{8-char-taskId}
- **Non-blocking**: Process detachment with unref() for immediate server response
- **Claude Execution**: Runs in cloned repository directory (cwd parameter)
- **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging of Claude output with task IDs

## Testing Process
1. Start server with Phase 2 features enabled
2. Use `test-phase2.js` to simulate webhook events
3. Verify Claude spawning and task ID generation
4. Check work directory creation and repository cloning

## Pre-implementation for Phase 3-5
The implementation went beyond Phase 2 requirements and already includes:
- Complete command parsing for all three types ([review], [accept], PR review)
- Full event routing logic (issues, issue_comment, pull_request_review)
- processWebhook() function handling all webhook types
- Structure ready for Phase 3-5 implementation

## Next Steps
To complete Phase 3-5, only need to replace echo test prompts with real gh CLI commands at:
- Line ~92 in server.js (review command)
- Line ~97 in server.js (accept command)
- Line ~102 in server.js (PR review command)
