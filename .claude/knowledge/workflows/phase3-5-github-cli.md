All three phases (3, 4, 5) have been fully implemented with real GitHub CLI commands.

- Uses `gh issue view` to fetch issue details
- Claude analyzes the issue content
- Posts analysis via `gh issue comment`

### Phase 4 - Solution Implementation ([accept] command)  
When @homunculus [accept] is mentioned in an issue comment:
- Uses `gh issue view` to read the full issue context
- Claude implements the requested solution
- Creates feature branch and PR with `gh pr create`

### Phase 5 - PR Review Responses
When @homunculus is mentioned in a PR review:
- Uses `gh pr view` to read PR and review feedback

- Claude addresses feedback and pushes fixes

## Technical Implementation
- All phases implemented in single update to server.js (lines 108-124)
- Replaced test echo commands with real Claude prompts
